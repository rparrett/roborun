- Docs seem to indicate that you should use rust nightly, but the thing doesn't compile in rust nightly
- Rust stable seems to work for the most part. (1.32)
- cargo web start --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --port=8004 --release

TODO

- Show all-time-best robot as a ghost in a different collision group?
 - kiss3d can't do transparency, but maybe it's possible to render a wireframe.
- Surely I can hack together a simple circle shadow based on the body y vector
- Additional data vis for performance stats
- Better textures. Find some way to not clamp to both edges.
- Add additional interesting robot variants
- DRY the bots
- Let's make it possible to adjust various constants without recompiling
- Accomodate various computation speeds. Cycle through display of population and show for only the
  simulation period, until a new generation is ready.
- Make it possible to share genomes. qr-code? base100? base64?
