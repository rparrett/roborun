- Docs seem to indicate that you should use rust nightly, but the thing doesn't compile in rust nightly
- Rust stable seems to work for the most part. (1.32)
- cargo web start --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --port=8004 --release

TODO

- Show robot ghost from previous generation in a differet color / collision group
 - Is this even a good idea? Could get weird when things get stagnant. Last best unique individual.
- Surely I can hack together a simple circle shadow based on the body y vector
 - Or find some other way to make the lighting look less weird
- Show user a fun data visualization
- Better textures. Fine some way to not clamp to both edges.
- Add additional interesting robot variants
- Let's make it possible to adjust various constants without recompiling
- Accomodate various computation speeds. Cycle through display of population and show for only the
  simulation period, until a new generation is ready.
