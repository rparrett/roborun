TODO

- Some indication of the current-best bot
  - A ghost/wireframe (no transparency in kiss3d)
  - A circle on the ground
- Additional data vis for performance stats
- Better textures for bots and arena. Skybox?
- A simple circle shadow for the bot
- Add additional interesting robot variants
- DRY the bots
- Account for various computation speeds and population settings in bot display
  - We want to show a bot at least for the whole simulation period
  - If the sim of one generation takes a bit longer than that, it's okay
  - If the sim of one generation takes a great deal longer than that, it might be less okay
    - Bot might fall off of the world
  - If the sim of one generation is shorter than that, what should we display in the mean time?
- Make it possible to share genomes and replay genomes
  - QR?
  - base100?
  - base64?
- Should bots be responsible for providing a function that returns a random individual?
  - Or an IndividualBuilder?
- Figure out why Clippy isn't working
- For various settings inputs, we can check if the step value contains a decimal and get rid of the parse attribute
- Various settings are causing panics at extreme values
- Setting ideas
  - Simulation timestep
  - Friction
  - Mutation magnitude 
  - Genome sizemin/max genome size
- It would be nice if we didn't have to refresh the whole page after changing settings
- Split off robot step() into a DumbRobotBrain struct that each robot has an instance of?
